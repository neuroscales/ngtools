## Simple CORS-Enabled HTTP Server -- local_server.py

**Note: the script is designed to run in the same directory as the assets it is serving**

This script starts an HTTP server with CORS enabled, allowing `GET` and `OPTIONS` requests.

## How to Run
1. Save the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script directory:
   ```bash
   python local_server.py
   ```

The server will be persistent on port 8080
